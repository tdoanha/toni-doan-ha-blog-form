# Toni Doan-Ha Blog Form

This acts as a form to populate a local PostgreSQL database... for now. Later I will have this privately hooked up to a remote DB for my personal portfolio.

## Features that I'm working on:

- Viewing all posts
  - Sorting them in latest to oldest, oldest to newest
- Editing older posts
- Deleting posts

## Getting Started

### Installation

You'll need to clone this project and install the node modules via the terminal: `npm install`

Then you need to change the fetch() parameter to point to the endpoint, to an API that does CRUD operations on your database.

### Usage

Use `npm start` to run the app on https://localhost:3000.
